# DroidFi

**Incomplete**

DroidFi is a Wifi Phishing tool for Android. It is available on GitHub at https://github.com/HueyLouis/DroidFi. The tool can be used to perform phishing attacks on Wifi networks. The tool is written in Python and requires root access to run. 

To use DroidFi, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then, run the script with root access. The tool will create a fake access point and wait for users to connect to it. Once a user connects, the tool will capture their login credentials and display them in the console.

It is important to note that using DroidFi for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. The tool should only be used for educational purposes or with the explicit consent of the network owner.
